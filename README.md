# SheCodes-Basics
[SheCodes Basics](https://www.shecodes.io/basics.basics) is the perfect first dive into front-end development. I did all of the homework and I learned to build a page in HTML, how to style it and target specific elements in CSS and how to animate it with JavaScript. 

Files are simple and all of the html files contain CSS and a little bit Javascript coding.
